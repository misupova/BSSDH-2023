# Octoparse: a no-Coding solution for web Scraping

Octoparse is a visual, user-friendly tool designed for web scraping without the need for coding. It allows users to transform web pages into structured data within a few clicks.

## What is Octoparse?

Octoparse is a web scraping tool that enables users to extract data from various types of websites. With its user-friendly interface, Octoparse allows users to design their own scrapers in a workflow designer, visualizing everything in a browser. It's a no-coding solution, making it accessible to build web scrapers.

## Demonstration: [https://eng.lsm.lv/topic/nato/](https://eng.lsm.lv/topic/nato/)

1. **Setting up the task**: Start by creating a new task in Octoparse. Enter the URL (https://eng.lsm.lv/topic/nato/) in the 'Extract URL' box.
2. **Selecting the data to scrape**: Navigate to the webpage within Octoparse. You can select the data you want to scrape by clicking on it. For example, you might want to scrape the title, date, and content of each article. When you click on a piece of data, Octoparse will automatically generate a data field for it.
3. **Setting up the workflow**: After selecting all the data you want to scrape, you can set up the workflow in Octoparse. This involves telling Octoparse how to navigate the website and when to extract data. For example, you might tell Octoparse to click on each article, extract the selected data, and then go back to the main page.
4. **Running the task**: Once you've set up the workflow, you can run the task. Octoparse will automatically navigate the website and extract the data according to your instructions.
5. **Exporting the data**: After the task has finished running, you can export the data in a format of your choice (e.g., CSV, Excel, JSON).
